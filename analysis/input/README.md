I got my data sources from Pew research center. The data includes results from a 2017 survey on U.S. Muslims concerning their place in society. The survey includes questions from several sets of categories ranging from citizenship status to perceptions on American society. For my purposes, I will be using data from a few different questions concerning citizenship status (to determine voter eligibility), importance of religion (in determining degree of religiosity), voting behavior (to determine political participation), and immigrant generation level.
